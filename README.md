## Notes on working through the problems

We encourage a healthy mixture of your own implementations, and good choices of existing open-source libraries/tools. We will comment in the problems to indicate which ones cannot be solved purely through an off-the-shelf solution.

## Problems 

1. API rate-limiting

2. Client-side general chart visualizations

3. Client-side data table

4. Client-side geo visualizations
